Implementation of Fuzzy-C-means clustering algorithm for JavaScript/TypeScript - *STILL IN DEVELOPMENT*
## motivation
Why using C-means clustering algorithms in JavaScript/TypeScript? Yes, JavaScript is not a typical language for data science methods but JavaScript is still the language for browsers. So if you want to create an application for web and want to calculate the clusters on clientside, you need an implementation for JavaScript. The k-means algorithm exists widely in JavaScript-space but unfortunately not the (n-dimensional, $n\of\mathbb{N} \land n>3$ ) C-means algorithm which would always - instead of k-means - lead to same results. I don't want to create the perfect module for this but I want to set it public in hope to approximate it with the OpenSource community. So feel free to participate.

## Get started
You can add this module to your project by this github repository while it's not published on npm.
```
npm install https://github.com/durek1337/cmeans
```
