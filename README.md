# fcmeans
Implementation of Fuzzy-C-means clustering algorithm for JavaScript/TypeScript
## WARNING
This repository is still in development. The API of this module could change until there is a real first release. I do not guarantee the correctness of this module. Please review und participate if you have suggestions. Please think about giving a star to this repository to reach more people.

## Motivation
Why using Fuzzy-C-means clustering algorithms in JavaScript/TypeScript? Yes, JavaScript is not a typical language for data science methods but JavaScript is still the language for browsers. So if you want to create an application for web and want to calculate the clusters on clientside, you need an implementation for JavaScript. The k-means algorithm exists widely in JavaScript-space but unfortunately not the (n-dimensional, ![latex render n>3](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n\in\mathbb{N}%20\land%20n%3E3 "n\in\mathbb{N} \land n>3")) C-means algorithm.
## Get started
### Installing
You can add this module to your project by this github repository while it's not published on npm.
```
npm install https://github.com/durek1337/cmeans
```
or
```
yarn add https://github.com/durek1337/cmeans
```

### Importing
Simply import the module to use it.

ES6
```javascript
import fcmeans from 'fcmeans'
```

CommonJS
```javascript
const fcmeans = require('fcmeans')
```

### Example
```javascript
import fcmeans, {calculateFuzzifier} from 'fcmeans'
var amount = 50
var dimensions = 3
var max = 10
var min = 1
var data_vectors = (new Array(amount)).fill(0).map((e,i) => (new Array(dimensions)).fill(0).map((e) => Math.round((max-min)*Math.random())+min))
var clusters = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(amount))
var fuzzifier = calculateFuzzifier(dimensions,amount) // you could also use a value of 2 but some people write it's not a good habbit. Inform yourself before you use this provided function.
var result = fcmeans({k : clusters, vectors : data_vectors, epsilon : 0.0001, fuzziness : fuzzifier})
console.log("fuzzifier",fuzzifier,"result",JSON.stringify(result))
```

The assignments in <code>result.membershipMatrix.mtx</code> has a length of 7 (which is also stored in <code>result.membershipMatrix.cols</code>). This amount was calculated and stored in variable <code>clusters</code>. The values of <code>result.membershipMatrix.mtx</code> are between 0 and 1 but the values scatter around <code>1/clusters</code>. The sum of all elements of one membership array is 1 (negleted computation errors which could lead to a little bit more or less). This example has the following sums calculated by <code>JSON.stringify(x.membershipMatrix.mtx.map(arr => arr.reduce((pr,c) => pr+c)))</code>:
